# basic-informational-site
This project uses Node.js to serve and route basic HTML files from the server-side based on requested URL.

# Achieved Learning Goals
* **Basic http request handling**: Studied documentation to learn how to create HTTP server, access request URL, and set local host port.
* **Working with files using Node**: Used fs module to read files and send to HTTP response.
* **Running Node.js scripts**: Created simple scripts to shorten commands for running index.js with Node and running with watch mode.

# Start-up Guide

In Shell:
```
node index.js
